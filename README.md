This was a game I created a while ago for my final project in the Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science Course I took in highschool.
Although there are a few formatting errors, this code functions as an interactive game of Minesweeper which you can play from the console,
including emojis for the MineSweeper icons. 

This was the project where I first deeply explored the concept of recursion, which I used to help create the uncover/cover and box number logic 
(recursively checking each box's surrounding boxes).

This final project was the result of all the concepts I had accumulatively learned in Grade 11 ICS, all tied together in a neat little game of MineSweeper. 
If you play, I hope you enjoy! :)
